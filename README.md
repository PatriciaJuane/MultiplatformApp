# Multiplatform application developed with Angular 8, Nativescript and Firebase.

This application is the Final Thesis Project I developed for my Master's Degree in Computer Engineering, at University of A CoruÃ±a.

It stores data related to horse riding competitions (trophies, results, horses, riders and clubs).
All the users can read that data, but only logged in users are able to write it.

# Technologies

---
### Angular: framework chosen for this project. Powered by Google. The main features I used were:

-Modules
	
-Components (Typescript + HTML5 + CSS3)
	
-Services
	
-Pipes
	
-i18n with ngx-translate
	
-Angular Material
	

---
### Nativescript: used to extend the Angular project with mobile templates. It permits to extend an existing web project. The main features I used were:

-Own modules (.tns)
	
-Has its own component templates (.tns.html, .tns.css) and, sometimes, even its own typescript files (.tns.ts files).
	
-Whenever needed, it has its own services: for example, for Firebase, it uses nativescript-firebase-plugin, so we need to create a separate service than the web one.
	
-Own Nativescript elements: RadListView, RadSideDrawer.
	
-Android configuration files: AndroidManifest.xml, build.gradle.

---
	
### Firebase: used as our NoSQL database in the Cloud. Managed by Google. The features I used were:
	
-**Cloud Firestore**: I have two apps (web and Android) in Firebase to store the data in the Firestore database. We use CRUD operations in both firebase services to manipulate the data. 

-**Cloud Storage**: used to store the images associated to horses and riders.
	
-**Firebase Authentication** (login with Google Account): used to delegate the users management of the application. It uses Google log in, but many more could be integrated.

2. **Horses**: create horse (upload picture), see horse details (with its related results), see list of horses in the application.

3. **Riders**: create rider (upload picture), see rider details (with his/her related reuslts), see list of riders in the application.

4. **Clubs**: create club, see club details (with its related results), see list of clubs in the application.

5. **Competitions**: create competition, see competition details (with list of trophies), see list of competitions at Home page.

6. **Trophies**: create trophy, see trophy details (with list of results), see list of trophies associated to a competition.

# Instalation and execution instructions

Clone this repository in your local machine.

Install Node.js and the Android SDK.

Run this commands:

1. npm install -g @angular/cli -> to install Angular CLI

2. npm install -> for building the web app

3. npm install -g nativescript -> to install nativescript

4. tns build -> for building the mobile app

5. tns doctor -> for mobile app: needed to see if our machine has all the requirements needed to execute the Android app.


Finally, to execute the app:

1. npm start or ng serve -> for executing the web app

2. tns run android -> for executing the mobile Android app (you need an Android emulator or an Android device, both with the Nativescript playground app installed).

## Personal Comments
This was my first application developed with Nativescript and Firebase, and now I'm definitely a huge fan of both technologies.
Thank you very much for taking the time to look at this repository!
